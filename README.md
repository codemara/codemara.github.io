Hi I am a fullstack and mobile developer based in Calgary, Canada

This website is deployed on Vercel and built with Next.JS and TypeScript.  

It showcases some my following skills:

[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=java,spring,nodejs,nextjs,react,androidstudio,js,ts,css,html,figma,php,mysql,sqlite,svg,tailwind,vercel,wordpress,sketchup&theme=light)](https://reactskillicons.dev)

This is the first release and here is the road map for further development:
- Add more SVG animations
- Add skills icons
- Make sections into classes
- Add more examples of past works for portfolio
- Add articles section
- Add bio section
