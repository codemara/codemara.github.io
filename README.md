This website is deployed on Vercel and built with Next.JS and TypeScript.

It showcases some my following skills:

This is the first release and here is the road map for further development:
- Add more SVG animations
- Add skills icons
- Make sections into classes
- Add more examples of past works for portfolio
- Add articles section
- Add bio section
