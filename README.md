This website is deployed on Vercel and built with Next.JS and TypeScript.

It showcases some my following skills:

This is the first release and here is the road map for further development:
- Add skills icons
- Add more SVG animations
- Make sections into classes
- Make frontend fully dynamic
- Add a NoSQL database for content
- Add more examples of past works and projects
- Add articles section
- Add bio section
